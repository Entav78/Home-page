# Portfolio Homepage

This project is a personal portfolio homepage created to showcase my skills as a frontend developer. It includes links to three selected projects, each displayed as a card with the project title, description, a screenshot, and links to the GitHub repository and live version of the project.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The homepage is fully responsive and adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Project Cards**: Each project card includes a description, title, project screenshot, and links to the live site and GitHub repository.
- **Clean & Simple Layout**: A minimalistic design ensures that the focus is on the content and projects.
- **About Me Section**: This section introduces who I am, giving an overview of my skills, interests, and professional background.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and semantic layout of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling and ensuring responsiveness using Flexbox and Grid.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the live version of the site.
